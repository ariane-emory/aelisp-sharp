## To Do - replicating features from the C impelemtation of Ã†lisp:
- [ ] plist handling:
  - [ ] data layer.
  - [ ] core layer.
- [ ] Implement REPL, maybe use ReadLine package?
- [ ] Find sensible/useful things for this implementation to put in object properties.
- [ ] OS interaction functions (data layer/core):
  - [ ] load/require/provide/read.
  - [ ] the rest of 'em.
- [ ] C#-level unit tests (XUnit?).

## To Do:
- [ ] Find an excuse to use T4 somewhere (just to learn how to work with it).
- [ ] Refactor the stdlib and tests into it's own repo and try running it.
- [ ] Organize/tidy up building the root and make Main sensible, it's a construction zone ATM.
- [ ] Sensible/useful command line arguments (maybe find a getopt-like package?).
- [ ] Binary/hex number tokens?
- [ ] Rearrange APIs:
  - [ ] Let's make Envs the main entry point for user-level interaction.
  - [ ] Eliminate mutable globals.
  - [ ] Possibility of multiple, independant 'root' environments.
- [ ] A radically different (whitespace sensitive?) non-Lispy syntax option that might just evolve into a 2nd language.

## Completed:
- [x] Math comparison functions.
- [x] DRY up the int-only math methods.
- [x] ~/bit-not.

## Completed with alterations:
- [x] Math operator functions (probably gen with T4): done without T4.
- [x] Make princ the default ToString(): solved at Core layer instead, raw is based on ToString while others use ToPrincString / To PrintString.
