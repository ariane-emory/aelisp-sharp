# Ælisp#

A reimplementation of [ÆLisp](https://github.com/ariane-emory/aelisp) in C# using [pidgin](https://github.com/benjamin-hodgson/Pidgin) (alongside a custom tokenizer) to do its parsing. Largely seems to be working well under the hood, but doesn't have a user friendly REPL, sensible command line options or unit tests yet.
